    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a brief introduction to the Path4GMNS, highlighting the DTALite functional modules within it.<br>\n",
    "Whether you want to use Path4GMNS seriously or want to contribute to the project, it may be helpful to understand its functional structure and data examples. The tutorial will show you the macro structure of Path4GMNS and the basics of how to install and use it, with specific data examples in the nine subsequent documents. Before you learn about the data cases we provide and use Path4GMNS, it is recommended that you go through the contents of this tutorial to get an initial understanding of Path4GMNS and complete its installation and configuration."

Besides finding static shortest paths for simple analyses, its main functionality is to provide an efficient and flexible framework for column-based (path-based) modeling and applications in transportation (e.g., activity-based demand modeling).
